# AWS_Cloud_Practitioner_Slides
Slides for freeCodeCamp's AWS course.

The repo contains a pdf with all the slides in titled: *'all_slides.pdf'*.

The *'slides_by_chapter'* directory holds 27 pdf files for slides split by topic chapter.

This repo was created using the Python Pillow image library and Jupyter Notebook.
Thanks to GitHub user Mainak99 for the original PNGs which I converted to pdf and merged based on chapter.
